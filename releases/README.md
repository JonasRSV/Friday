# Release

The release currently depends on you having [libtensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c) installed on the device. 


### TODO installation guide

For raspberrypi and linux I have provided them under platforms.Resources.


### Launching

Once a release is unzipped and libtensorflow installed, launch the assistant with:

```bash
FRIDAY_GUI=nightout FRIDAY_CONFIG=. ./'BINARY_NAME_HERE'
```

If any errors occur, please following the suggestions in the error messages and hopefully things will resolve themselves. If not, please create an issue!
